# Simple-coffe-machine
This is a very easy and quick project that i made without GUI  just to train OOP, it is very crude but i will sure make a gui for it in the future.
It has no dependencies and runs on the terminal. just the main part is mine,the rest was taken from an UDEMY COURSE BY Angela 100 days of python bootcamp.
